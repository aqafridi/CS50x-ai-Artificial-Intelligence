# Flask Face Detection
#### Video Demo:  [Flask Face Detection video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCobzHSHbTM) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCobzHSHbTM
#### Description:
A face detection web app powered by SSD face detector using Flask, OpenCV,tensrflow.
this use flask as server and python for multiprocessing.
This appilcation draw boundary bosexs around them and count them.
this use flask as server which create url and then can be checked in browser and python for multiprocessing and AI.
This appilcation draw boundary bosexs around them and count them and dectect where is face.
This is final project for cs50.

### future development:
it can be used for security purpose and attendance systems.

### thanks:
i thank to all cs50 course people for bringing this incredible course free to the public.
